# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: Tebibu Kebede

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

Summary
Through the Kotlin Debug-a-thon assignment, I had the opportunity to learn about the basics of Kotlin syntax, including variables,
functions, and classes. In addition, I was able to develop my skills in debugging common errors in Android Studio and refactoring 
Kotlin code for improved efficiency and organization. Overall, this assignment provided me with valuable experience in identifying
and resolving issues that can arise when working with Kotlin, and helped me to become more confident in my ability to write clean, 
functional code. As I continue to develop my skills in Kotlin programming,I am grateful for the foundation that this assignment
has provided me with.


Tebibu 2 is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **Change or add to this description**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: Laughing emoji, Suprised emoji, excited emoji
